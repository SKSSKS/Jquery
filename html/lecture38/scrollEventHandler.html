        Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha (along with the hare and the pika). Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the over 200 breeds of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes thirteen wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail. The rabbit is familiar as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet throughout much of the world. With its far-reaching effect on ecologies and on cultures, the rabbit (or bunny) has made its way into our daily life—as food, clothing, and companion—and our art, as symbol and muse.
